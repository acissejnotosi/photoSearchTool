# Photo Finder Website

It is a photo search engine using the [Unsplash API](Take a look on it and enjoy.). Through Photo Finder the user can search for photos and even filter by orientation, color and sort by most relevant or recently posted photos.

The photos finder was built with React framework and Typescript. Also, SCSS syntax was used for the styling of the website.

The Redux Toolkit library was used to control the application's state. One of the challenges encountered during development was managing asynchronous calls with [createAsyncThunk](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-6-async-logic#using-the-redux-thunk-middleware).

# Production Version

The production version is available on [Versel](https://vercel.com/) through the [this link](https://photo-search-tool.vercel.app/)
